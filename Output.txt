Note that a value of null means that the flight departure is too far out to have a specific cause for delay. Within ~24 hours, delay casues kick in. Represents the number of minutes from the scheduled arrival time (negative number means an early arrival, positive means a late arrival), with special cases in the 10000 range:- `10000` - no flight (flight was not on the schedule on this day)- `10001` - no data (flight is in the schedule for this day, but arrival time data is missing)- `10002` - cancellation (flight was cancelled on this day)- `10003` - diversion (flight was diverted on this day)Weather forecast information at origin or destination airport. This forecast corresponds to the weather predicted at the departure or arrival time, respectively.Indicates the source of the real time data. The default source of flight data is `flightview`.
